The exact content of the Pakistan government\u2019s \u2018Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan\u2019 used for deportations has never been made public, but it comes amid a campaign to wrongfully demonize Afghan nationals as so-called criminals and terrorists. \u201cThe Pakistani government\u2019s unyielding and cruel deadline, which is less than a week away, to remove Afghan refugees and asylum seekers from two major cities, resulting in deportation of many at risk, shows little respect for international human rights law, particularly the principle of non-refoulement."

On the grounds of seeking to strengthen the work of the APCI, the law undermines civic space, which is essential for citizen engagement, accountability of authorities and justice, as it increases undue control over the work of civil society organizations and leaves the door open to arbitrary restrictions, discretionality and censorship. It is important to note that civil society organizations already have to provide accountability and are subject to regular monitoring and oversight procedures."

Amendments to the Prisons Law, the Juvenile Criminal Law and the Law against Organized Crime worsen the conditions of persons deprived of their liberty and establish a disproportionate and punitive prison treatment, particularly for children and adolescents."

His victory in the case, which should have brought attention and reparations for the devastating environmental damage that occurred in Ecuador, instead morphed into an array of retaliation against Donziger himself, resulting in numerous judicial proceedings, nearly 1000 days of house arrest, 45 days in prison, and an ongoing legal battle. It has been a clear-cut case of abuse of the justice system by a major corporation to target and harass human rights defenders \u2013 and how the case is closed will set an important precedent."

Despite releases from prison in 2023 and 2024, many people continue to be deprived of their liberty for political reasons or simply for expressing anti-government views. The harassment, intimidation and misuse of criminal law that initially targeted protesters, activists, political opponents, journalists, human rights defenders and indigenous leaders has been extended to society as a whole and now affects anyone perceived as a threat to official policy or the state narrative."

On 19 November 2024, Egypt\u2019s parliament approved the country\u2019s first asylum law, which restricts the right to seek asylum, lacks due process guarantees and shifts the responsibility for registering asylum seekers and determining their refugee status from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to the Egyptian government. The law, which does not explicitly prohibit refoulement, comes against the backdrop of Egyptian police and the EU-funded Border Guard Forces carrying out mass arrests and unlawful deportations of Sudanese refugees who crossed into Egypt seeking safety from the raging armed conflict in Sudan."

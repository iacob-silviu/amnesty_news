The exact content of the Pakistan government\u2019s \u2018Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan\u2019 used for deportations has never been made public, but it comes amid a campaign to wrongfully demonize Afghan nationals as so-called criminals and terrorists. \u201cThe Pakistani government\u2019s unyielding and cruel deadline, which is less than a week away, to remove Afghan refugees and asylum seekers from two major cities, resulting in deportation of many at risk, shows little respect for international human rights law, particularly the principle of non-refoulement."

On the grounds of seeking to strengthen the work of the APCI, the law undermines civic space, which is essential for citizen engagement, accountability of authorities and justice, as it increases undue control over the work of civil society organizations and leaves the door open to arbitrary restrictions, discretionality and censorship. It is important to note that civil society organizations already have to provide accountability and are subject to regular monitoring and oversight procedures."

Amendments to the Prisons Law, the Juvenile Criminal Law and the Law against Organized Crime worsen the conditions of persons deprived of their liberty and establish a disproportionate and punitive prison treatment, particularly for children and adolescents."

His victory in the case, which should have brought attention and reparations for the devastating environmental damage that occurred in Ecuador, instead morphed into an array of retaliation against Donziger himself, resulting in numerous judicial proceedings, nearly 1000 days of house arrest, 45 days in prison, and an ongoing legal battle. It has been a clear-cut case of abuse of the justice system by a major corporation to target and harass human rights defenders \u2013 and how the case is closed will set an important precedent."

Despite releases from prison in 2023 and 2024, many people continue to be deprived of their liberty for political reasons or simply for expressing anti-government views. The harassment, intimidation and misuse of criminal law that initially targeted protesters, activists, political opponents, journalists, human rights defenders and indigenous leaders has been extended to society as a whole and now affects anyone perceived as a threat to official policy or the state narrative."

On 19 November 2024, Egypt\u2019s parliament approved the country\u2019s first asylum law, which restricts the right to seek asylum, lacks due process guarantees and shifts the responsibility for registering asylum seekers and determining their refugee status from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to the Egyptian government. The law, which does not explicitly prohibit refoulement, comes against the backdrop of Egyptian police and the EU-funded Border Guard Forces carrying out mass arrests and unlawful deportations of Sudanese refugees who crossed into Egypt seeking safety from the raging armed conflict in Sudan."

To do so will result in more effective and more sustainable outcomes; remedies for unavoidable harms; reductions in historic inequalities often stemming from racist and colonial legacies; and will point the way towards climate justice for all, one of the key priorities for the Brazilian presidency. A full, fast, fair and funded fossil fuel phase out as part of a just and equitable transition towards renewable energy, and a massive scale up of climate finance in line with the polluter pays principle, together with reform of the global financial architecture, are urgent and essential."

Sending people to countries to which they have no connection, no support and no prospects, or may have only briefly transited through, is not only chaotic and arbitrary, but also devastating on a human level."

The Court found that the designation of a country as safe must offer the possibility of an effective and transparent judicial review, and be based on sources of information that are accessible, something that Italy currently does not guarantee. Unless Italy complies with the ruling in law and practice, transfers to Albania based on the use of the \u2018safe country of origin\u2019 concept would not be in line with EU law."

It is past time Saudi Arabia put an end to its disgraceful use of the death penalty, which includes executing people for crimes they allegedly committed as children, and leaves families torn apart and devastated."
